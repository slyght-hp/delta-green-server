  <p class="text-left"> In locker XX at the XX bus station in XX, California, you will find a burner phone. </p>
  <p class="text-left"> A number has been pre-programmed. </p>
  <p class="text-left"> Use this, and only this, to contact your handler, Agent XX. </p>
  <p class="text-left"> You will also find your cover identity, which shows you to be a member of an FBI Task Force. </p>
  <p class="text-left"> The cover will hold up at a glance, but don't give anyone a reason to dig deeper into your identity. </p>
  <p class="text-left"> There are three Beretta 9mm handguns with two clips of ammunition apiece. </p>
  <p class="text-left"> Should you need anything else, contact Agent XX. </p>
  <p class="text-left"> Keep Agent XX informed of your progress. </p>
  <p class="text-left pb-4"> Destroy the phone when the operation is complete. </p>
